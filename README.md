# NYCDA WD Bonus JavaScript Assignment
A project that I created during my New York Code + Design Academy Web Dev 100 class in Philly after Week 3 Lecture 2. This project was a JavaScript kata.

### Assignment:
FizzBuzz!

Write a program that logs to the console the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.  The output should look like this:
```bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
(etc)
```
You can either put your code in a function that you define and then invoke it later, or just put your code in "global scope" (i.e. inside the javascript file not wrapped in a function).
